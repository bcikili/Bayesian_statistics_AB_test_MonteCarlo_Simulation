# Bayesian_statistics_AB_test_MonteCarlo_Simulation
This code uses A/B testing and Monte Carlo simulation using R for answering the following question.

Q: Which type of mold-removal solution works better: just bleaching objects, or bleaching them and scrubbing them down thoroughly. You're trying to determine whether the mold will grow back or not, using the following table:

Mold Removel Type      |      Mold Returned    |       Did Not Return       |      Ratio
_______________________________________________________________________________________
Bleach                 |        27             |        39                  |       .41
_______________________________________________________________________________________

Bleach and Scrubing    |        10             |       45                   |       .18
